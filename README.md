# k8s-homeserver

The idea is to run everything at my home on cheap/low energy consumption nodes in a cluster. (currently this is 3 node cluster, with the nvidia nano jetson on order :-)). The k8s cluster will use a Synology 1511+ for database (MySQL) and NFS storage. The plan is to run the following services on this cluster:
- [ ] Home Assistant
- [ ] Sabnzbd
- [ ] Sickchill
- [ ] Spotweb
- [ ] Plex
- [ ] Reverse Proxy for URLs 
- [ ] influxdb/prometheus
